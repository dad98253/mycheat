[BUGS]
No known bugs.
[EXAMPLE]
A common use for the program is to help with certain word puzzles. The output generated by the program is
equivalent to the following bash example that utilized the permute command to find the
perturbations of the string "FFERO" and then pass the output through a spell checker to generate a list
of possible English words:

       permute FFERO |sort|uniq>in.txt ; comm -23 in.txt <(aspell list < in.txt) 2>/dev/null
